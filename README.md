sickdays-a-javafx-app
=====================

Sick Days is a JavaFX application built in scala using a custom Presentation Model implementation.

The repo should be an (almost) working eclipse project as soon as the "gradle eclipse" command is run. Currently you will need to manually remove "src/main" from the build paths for the project to work as there is a bug in the plugin used for JavaFX support (http://speling.shemnon.com/blog/2012/11/07/javafx-gradle-plugin-0.0.0-released/).
